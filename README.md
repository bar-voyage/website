# Bar Voyage üçªüçæ

A [mobile application](https://bar-voyage.github.io/website/about) that informs and guides users through an optimized fun night out by providing tailored recommendations and real-time, crowd-sourced images. Our application eliminates disappointing & aimless hopping from one bar to the next; not knowing if the next will be any better. By giving Voyagers the power to view live content of a bar from others within the community, we are able to empower others to join and share their own experiences and contribute back to the Bar Voyage community.

Check out [our website](bar-voyage.github.io/website) for more details on our application!
