<p><strong>Here's what provide you:</strong></p>
1. <strong>Recommendations: </strong>Targeted bar suggestions based on your location, preferences and what we think youâ€™ll love
2. <strong>Live, Crowd-sourced Content: </strong>Real-time photos and reviews of bars to make informed decisions
3. <strong>Ratings: </strong>Give reviews and share your experiences with other voyagers




<p><strong>Want to be a Voyager? It's easy. All you have to do is sign up and:</strong></p>

1. <strong>Choose</strong> your ideal night out 
2. <strong>Discover</strong> where to start or continue your night
3. <strong>Submit</strong> ratings and photos at each stop

<p><strong>Bar Voyage</strong> eliminates disappointing & aimless hopping from one bar to the next; not knowing if the next will be any better. By giving Voyagers the power to view live content of a bar from others within the community, we are able to empower others to join and share their own experiences and contribute back to the Bar Voyage community.</p>
